# Python Encrypter and Decrypter

This code represents a console application for encrypting and decrypting words up to ten characters in length.
The application employs a simple logic of altering the ASCII values of characters to achieve encryption and decryption.

# Functionalities Description

Encryption (ENC_logic): The user inputs a word, and each letter of the word is "encrypted" by decreasing its ASCII value by a step
equal to the letter's position in the word (for example, the first letter is decreased by 1, the second by 2, etc.). The result is printed to the console.

Decryption (DNC_logic): The user inputs an encrypted word, and each letter of the word is "decrypted" by increasing its ASCII value by a step
equal to the letter's position in the word. The result is printed to the console.

# Usage Instructions

Upon launching the program, the user is greeted with a message guiding them on how to use the application.
To encrypt a word, the user should enter "ENC", followed by the word they wish to encrypt.
To decrypt a word, the user should enter "DNC", followed by the word they wish to decrypt.
To terminate the application, the user should enter "Exit".

This code demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, and string manipulation, as well as a simple form of cryptography.
